# A Twitter Bot That Tweets Lyrics

The code involves:
* using the Spotify web API to fetch the current track being played
* parse through the information recieved for the track name and the artist name
* use the Genius API to look for the lyrics of the current track
* wrangle the data recieved from genius and format it to a form that can be tweeted
* choose a verse/line at random to be tweeted
* use the Twitter API to send out the tweet

The code for the bot is private as it includes sensitive information required to connect to the Spotify, Genius & Twitter APIs.

Read about why I thought building this bot was a good idea [in this medium article](https://medium.com/@tahsinac/lyrics-are-a-form-of-literature-this-twitter-bot-will-help-you-see-it-a8f19cc1078e).
